    """
    Query the bandwidth (maximum distance) at which the average number of neighbors is maximized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates
        Spatial coordinates of spots.
    start
        Starting bandwidth.
    end
        Ending bandwidth.
    interval_n
        Number of bandwidths to query. Used to generate a linearly spaced
        interval between `start` and `end`. Default is 50.
    reference
        Reference coordinates to query the neighbors from. Default is `None`,
        which will use `coordinates`.
    figure_size
        Size of the returned figure as a `(width, height)` tuple.

    Returns
    -------
    A `plotnine` plot and a `pandas` DataFrame with the following columns:
        - `bandwith`: the bandwidth (maximum distance) at which the average
        number of neighbors is maximized.
        - `neighbours`: the average number of neighbors at the specified
        bandwidth.

    Examples
    --------
    Helps choose the `bandwidth` for :func:`liana.pp.spatial_neighbors` by
    showing how many neighbours each candidate value admits:

    >>> import liana as li
    >>> adata = li.ds.generate_toy_spatial()
    >>> fig, df = li.pp.query_bandwidth(adata.obsm['spatial'], start=0, end=1000)
